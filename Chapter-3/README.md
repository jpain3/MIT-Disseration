#Chapter 3 - Simpler is (Sometimes) Better: A Comparison of Cost Reducing Agent Architectures in a Simulated Behaviorally Driven Multi-Echelon Supply Chain

This repository hosts the Model and Supporting files for Chapter 3 of my disseration, titled "Simpler is (Sometimes) Better: A Comparison of Cost Reducing Agent Architectures in a Simulated Behaviorally Driven Multi-Echelon Supply Chain"

Note that within the 'Model-Predictive Learning' folder there is a subfolder of specific examples. These examples run the model-predictive learning agent based on a given model (heuristic vs base-stock), given optimization goal (self or myopic versus global or non-myopic), and information availability.
