		by the infludence of inventory coverage. This is generally modeled in a \
		manner similar to Chapter 20 from Business Dynamics. Specfically, refer to \
		Figure 20-14 and the surrouding text. A notable difference is the \
		exculsion of an explict mechanism to influence spot prices on the \
		'expected production costs'. That mechanism introduces yet another \
		sensitivty parameter, and is captured in part by the use of Gross Margins \
		to affect demand signals elsewhere in the model. If evidence of this \
		'expected produciton costs' mechanism is found in determining more \
		immediate spot prices in this environment, this could be added via the \
